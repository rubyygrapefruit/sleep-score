# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

What you will see in this project:

1 x Dropdown

- Label: "Duration in bed"
- Items: 0-24 hours, in 30-minute increments

1 x Dropdown

- Label: "Duration asleep"
- Items: 0-24 hours, in 30-minute increments

1 x button

- Initially disabled
- When the User selects a value for both time inputs, then the button is enabled.

When the User clicks the button:

- Text displays “Loading”

Output:

- After "saving" successfully, there would be an ouput text with the score (100 \* duration_asleep/duration_in_bed)

Different scenarios: (Duration in bed should be greater or equal to duration asleep)

- Duration asleep options will be based on duration in bed hours
  - For example: If 8 hours of duration in bed is selected, then duration asleep will show only options up to 8 as well.
- If any time the user selects not a proper valid selection in either dropdown, the button would be disabled

I created a public mock API post request with Postman -

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
